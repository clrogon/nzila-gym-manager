# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct: Nzila Community

## 🤝 Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of the Nzila Gym Manager project pledge to make participation in our project and our community a **harassment-free and inclusive experience** for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We believe that a diverse community is a strong community, and we are committed to treating all members with respect and dignity.

## ✨ Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

*   **Demonstrating Empathy and Kindness:** Be considerate of the time and effort of others. We are all here to learn and contribute.
*   **Constructive Feedback:** Giving and gracefully accepting constructive criticism. Focus on the code and the idea, not the person.
*   **Respectful Disagreement:** Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. Disagreement is natural, but respect is mandatory.
*   **Taking Responsibility:** Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes. We all make them.
*   **Focusing on the Community:** Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community and the project's users.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

## 🚨 Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it immediately by contacting the project maintainers at **security@gymmanager.local**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, ensuring the confidentiality of the reporter.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
